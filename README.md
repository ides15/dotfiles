# dotfiles

Uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) (`brew install stow`) to manage symlinking dotfiles.

```sh
stow .
```

Expects [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to be installed.

TODO:
 - [Brewfile](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)
 - nvm installation
 - aws CLI
 - how to separate work stuff into different repository
 - Finch (vs. Docker)
